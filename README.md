### Calibre in PortableApps.com Format (PAF) modified for eBook Developers

The [official release](https://portableapps.com/apps/office/calibre-portable) of Calibre in PAF format by [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/) does not allow you to launch the [Calibre Viewer](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/#the-calibre-e-book-viewer) or the [Calibre Editor](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/#editing-e-books) from the [PortableApps.com Platform](https://portableapps.com/download). This [modified](https://portableapps.com/node/71972) version of CalibrePortable does.

This is most useful for eBook Developers because you don't have to import to the Calibre Library, you can directly work on creating or editing your eBook files with [Calibre Editor](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/#editing-e-books) and simultaneously preview them as you are developing or modifying them with [Calibre Viewer](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/#the-calibre-e-book-viewer). All without having to launch the [main Calibre manager](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/#the-main-calibre-user-interface).
